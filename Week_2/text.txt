• Palo Alto Networks was unable to build data center capacity quickly
enough to meet the growing needs of application teams.
• As it transitioned to the AWS public cloud, the company needed a
consistent enterprise-grade load balancing solution that would deliver
across multicloud environments.
• The company needed to support its firewall in Amazon AWS in front of
load balancers and applications for security.

• The Avi Vantage Platform is a fully elastic, multicloud application delivery
platform with centrally managed, distributed load balancers.
• Avi offers unprecedented application insights to monitor applications
and troubleshoot performance issues.
• Avi Vantage not only reduces TCO by eliminating hardware and
overprovisioning requirements, but also autoscales on-demand in
response to real-time traffic.
 Avi Vantage streamlined infrastructure provisioning and workload
migration, allowing Palo Alto Networks to focus on applications rather
than on infrastructure.
• The company reduced average troubleshooting time by several hours,
thanks to Avi’s application insights and performance monitoring.
• The IT team shortened average application deployment time from days
to hours with enterprise-grade tools.
